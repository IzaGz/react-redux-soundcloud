# react-redux-soundcloud

I wrote a huge tutorial about setting up your own SoundCloud client with React + Redux. You can find it here: http://www.robinwieruch.de/the-soundcloud-client-in-react-redux/

Moreover you can find a real world example of my own SoundCloud client as source code https://github.com/rwieruch/favesound-redux and live version http://www.favesound.de/

This repository should give you an entry point for a React + Redux + SoundCloud Boilerplate project. The outcoume of the tutorial will be in the base folder.

There are more folders marked as extension. These folders pair with a blogpost itself and can be applied on the base tutorial http://www.robinwieruch.de/the-soundcloud-client-in-react-redux/
