# react-redux-soundcloud

I wrote a huge tutorial about setting up your own [SoundCloud Client in React + Redux](http://www.robinwieruch.de/the-soundcloud-client-in-react-redux/). Additonally you can find a real world example of my own SoundCloud Client as [source code](https://github.com/rwieruch/favesound-redux) and [live version](http://www.favesound.de/).

The react-redux-soundcloud repository should give you an entry point for a React + Redux + SoundCloud boilerplate project with multiple possible extensions. The outcome of [the SoundCloud Client in React + Redux](http://www.robinwieruch.de/the-soundcloud-client-in-react-redux/) can be found in the base-init/ folder. 

There are more folders marked as extension-*/. Each of them pairs with a blogpost and can be applied on base-init/ project.

If you only search for a seed project for your React + Redux + SoundCloud app, simply use the base-init/ folder to begin. If you want to get started in som other domains, please have a look at the extension-*/ folders.
