# react-redux-soundcloud

I wrote a huge tutorial about setting up your own SoundCloud client with React + Redux. You can find it here: http://www.robinwieruch.de/the-soundcloud-client-in-react-redux/

Moreover you can find a real world example of my own SoundCloud client as source code https://github.com/rwieruch/favesound-redux and live version http://www.favesound.de/

This repository should give you an entry point for all my follow up blog posts. Below you find a list of folders. The init folder is the outcome of the tutorial http://www.robinwieruch.de/the-soundcloud-client-in-react-redux/

More folders will follow. They will pair with a blogpost and build up on top of my React + Redux SoundCloud client tutorial.
